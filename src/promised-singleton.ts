/**
 * The PromisedSingleton is a generic wrapper for an asynchronous object that you only
 * want one instance of (a singleton).
 *
 * For the braintree libraries, we only want to load them once. This presents a problem
 * when several consumers request the clients at once. The Promises don't automatically
 * chain so you have to do some gatekeeping to make sure only one instance gets created.
 *
 * `PromisedSingleton` ensures that no matter how many callers request the object,
 * only one instance gets created.
 *
 * It gets initialized with a Promise that generates the singleton and when `get()` is
 * first called, it executes the Promise, caches its results and returns it to the caller.
 *
 * If more callers call it in the interim, it chains the promises and when the singleton
 * is created, it resolves them all.
 *
 * @export
 * @class PromisedSingleton
 * @template T
